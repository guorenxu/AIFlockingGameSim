This is a project I made for an AI class at Columbia College Chicago.

It simulates two teams playing a game where they try to collect and maintain as many little "flockers" as they can.

The flockers, once belonging to a team, will always try to flock around its most recent collector.

The players have a few different states, but will generally try to collect flockers when they have few and run away from opponent players when they have many.
